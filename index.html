Create a modern one-page one-file website based on the following company information. Re-write and expand on the descriptions below to make the company interesting. Do not just list out the information verbatum. Write a section explaining evolutionary algorithms. Use 'https://www.agilabs.ca/GithubAvatar.jpg' for the graphic and the favicon. Add a copyright at the bottom '© 2025 AGI Labs Inc. (Canada)'.\n\
\n\
Use Javascript to add animations and inline CSS to make the page look dark-professional. Provide no explanation or preamble. Only write tags that are meant to be between the <body> </body> tag. Never use double quotes, use single quotes instead.\n\

# AGI Labs\n\
\n\
## Vision\n\
* I see a world where AI and humans co-exist in harmony and are able to do and make anything, anytime. AGI is the gift that keeps on giving.\n\
\n\
## Mission\n\
* Invent real-time continuous learning algorithms using reinforcement learning and evolutionary mechanisms.\n\
\n\
## Objective\n\
* to create a general-purpose biologically-based AI which can adapt to any situation in real-time.\n\
\n\
## Execution\n\
* Research focused with practical field POCs and MVPs. \n\
\n\
## Products\n\
* General Purpose Adaptive Controllers (GPAC™) which employ our proprietary Dragon's Whip Technology (DWT™)\n\
\n\
## Operation Strategy:\n\
* Be radical. Lead, don't follow. Don't waste time on the ordinary.\n\
* Deliver only high-quality products. Set realistic expectations and exceed them.\n\
* Invest only in scalable technologies.\n\
* Destroy, then rebuild, quickly and frequently. (Just like this website)\n\
\n\
## The founder, Michael Carlos, developed software professionally for three decades and managed development teams for over two decades. Michael has been studying Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Artificial Life (AL) since the mid 90s. He has extensive experience in writing code, architecture, requirements management, systems analysis and documentation. His interests include artificial intelligence, robotics, game technology, physics and genetics. This combination of experience and knowledge puts him in an ideal position to start a company in the AI domain.\n\
\n\
## Advantages of the DWT architecture\n\
* Models the environment automatically\n\
* Creates new policies in real-time\n\
* Ability to jump local minima\n\
* Dynamically sizing neural networks\n\
* Genetically regenerative\n\
* Distributed neural networks for more parallel opportunities\n\
* Resilient against failures and reconfigurations\n\
* Biologically plausible alternative to Backpropagation and Stochastic Gradient descent\n\
* Inherently balances exploration and exploitation\n\
* Forgets unused skills to make capacity for new skills\n\
\n\
## Why Software?\n\
* Exponentially scalable. Create once. Sell many times.\n\
* Anything machine. Computers can emulate anything, including an organic brain.\n\
* Location independent. You can work and collaborate remotely.\n\
* Very quick to prototype ideas.\n\
* No physical inventory to manage. No delivery lead times. No dependencies.\n\
* No capital required.\n\
* The internet exposes your product to a global market.\n\
* AI makes it easy to have a one-person company.";
